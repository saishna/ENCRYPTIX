The sex scenes are athletic and loud, as in real life -- and pointedly in contrast to the soft-focus, lyrical artificial look of most movie love scenes. Adult but not pornographic, not suitable for children, but a great starting point for discussion in a romance. This is shocking comedy about socially relevant issues to stimulate audiences, comedy that is physical without becoming fstupid, farce that is ribald without becoming pornographic. HOLLYWOOD LOVE presents a hyper modern version of the battles of sex and the sexes, influenced by feminism and the sexual revolution and gender-bending. In the story, an innocent young man from the hills brings his guitar to Hollywood, hoping to break into show business, but meets his love match in the confused, mercurial Lana Lovely, and more than his match in their boss, Ms. Pringle, dominant director of music videos and sexual desires. The milieu is music video production in an underground Hollywood of wild rhythms, provocative dance, and freaky passions. The title song expresses the theme: Everybody likes to do things different; Love can be wild or love can be tame. Hollywood love is a different kind of love, Yet really true love remains the same.</td>\n",

She has the world at her feet, and the universe is her playground. But can such a well-developed sense of your own worth go too far? Self-assurance is greatly valued - until it spills over into an unhealthy overestimation of the self. In this incisive, personal visual essay, Gould explores our society's increasing obsession with the self. Thanks in part to social media, the pressure to have a fantastically successful life is ever greater; personal development seems to be the only thing that counts. The filmmaker follows a number of seemingly successful people going out, socializing and participating in the art world, as they reflect in conversations or interviews on the level of self-confidence they display and how this relates to their actual \"self.\" Meanwhile, dreamy reenactments tell the story of the filmmaker's sister Rowan, illustrated by excerpts from correspondence between the sisters. How marvelously everything is going; how fantastically she's doing; she's taking yet another inspirational course; she gets so many invites that there's simply no time. Gould gradually starts to question her interesting sister's stories, which leads to a disconcerting denouement. - See more at: https://www.idfa.nl/industry/tags/project.aspx?id=0EB122D3-2D7D-474F-9AFE-25948DD336E8#sthash.wgBgnTGl.dpuf Admiration for her sister Rowan's self-confidence leads filmmaker Ester Gould on a personal exploration of our narcissistic culture, with disconcerting results.

Over two nights -- September 10-11, 2006, just four months before Hillary announced the exploratory committee for her original presidential campaign, ABC aired The Path to 9/11, a riveting and factual docudrama. This acclaimed and balanced movie faulted two administrations -- Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. But fairness was not what Hillary wanted. Screenwriter Cyrus Nowrasteh told me he had expected the customary DVD distribution. But the Clintons, fearing the impact of DVD release during her campaign, successfully pressured Disney, which owns ABC, to bury the movie.

The sex scenes are athletic and loud, as in real life -- and pointedly in contrast to the soft-focus, lyrical artificial look of most movie love scenes. Adult but not pornographic, not suitable for children, but a great starting point for discussion in a romance. This is shocking comedy about socially relevant issues to stimulate audiences, comedy that is physical without becoming fstupid, farce that is ribald without becoming pornographic. HOLLYWOOD LOVE presents a hyper modern version of the battles of sex and the sexes, influenced by feminism and the sexual revolution and gender-bending. In the story, an innocent young man from the hills brings his guitar to Hollywood, hoping to break into show business, but meets his love match in the confused, mercurial Lana Lovely, and more than his match in their boss, Ms. Pringle, dominant director of music videos and sexual desires. The milieu is music video production in an underground Hollywood of wild rhythms, provocative dance, and freaky passions. The title song expresses the theme: Everybody likes to do things different; Love can be wild or love can be tame. Hollywood love is a different kind of love, Yet really true love remains the same.  \n",

After quitting his job at Nickelodeon (MTV Networks) Oren Stambouli decided that he was going to follow the flow of live to find people around the world that were pursuing their dreams. He understood that in order for this film to have an effect on people he had to find every day people pursuing \"impossible\" dreams and while shooting the film they will achieve them. On top of that he had an extra challenge; he didn't have a camera, a budget or even a script. But he had a story to tell and nothing was going to stop him from achieving his own dream.

       "37725   Ever since she was a young child, filmmaker Ester Gould has been amazed by the sheer self-confidence of her older sister Rowan, whose boundless creativity and natural beauty tended to make everyone around her jealous. She has the world at her feet, and the universe is her playground. But can such a well-developed sense of your own worth go too far? Self-assurance is greatly valued - until it spills over into an unhealthy overestimation of the self. In this incisive, personal visual essay, Gould explores our society's increasing obsession with the self. Thanks in part to social media, the pressure to have a fantastically successful life is ever greater; personal development seems to be the only thing that counts. The filmmaker follows a number of seemingly successful people going out, socializing and participating in the art world, as they reflect in conversations or interviews on the level of self-confidence they display and how this relates to their actual \"self.\" Meanwhile, dreamy reenactments tell the story of the filmmaker's sister Rowan, illustrated by excerpts from correspondence between the sisters. How marvelously everything is going; how fantastically she's doing; she's taking yet another inspirational course; she gets so many invites that there's simply no time. Gould gradually starts to question her interesting sister's stories, which leads to a disconcerting denouement. - See more at: https://www.idfa.nl/industry/tags/project.aspx?id=0EB122D3-2D7D-474F-9AFE-25948DD336E8#sthash.wgBgnTGl.dpuf Admiration for her sister Rowan's self-confidence leads filmmaker Ester Gould on a personal exploration of our narcissistic culture, with disconcerting results. A remarkable journey past four life stages and the fundamental need to be seen.  \n",

'The Madness' involves a young man who is suffering some terrible nightmares of his ex-wife, makes repeated visits to a psychiatrist, and ends up a pawn in an evil scheme. 'The Dead Forest' is about a man who attempts to bury his slaughtered newborn deep within a forest to cover his evil deed until he is tormented by the cries of his departed child and a disturbing vision. 'The Nudy Channel' revolves around a cable channel that features a temptress who speaks directly to the viewer, forcing them to commit suicide. 'Demon In The Basement' features a homemade video diary of a doctor revealing the secret monster kept in his basement that has been killing women in his home.

First, during the lecture films, the coeds drift into dreams of the most erotic fantasies one can imagine. After the films, they release the emotion of the fantasies in the most erotic and uncommon ways. One slips off to the curator's office for a little \"acquisition. \" Another finds the anthropologist to see what bones can be identified. Even the head teacher isn't immune. Soon the tour is over, but as the bus departs, everyone admits it was quite an education.  \n",
       "3   To help their unemployed father make ends meet, Edith and her twin sister Grace work as seamstresses . An invalid, Grace falls prey to the temptations of Chinatown opium and becomes an addict, a condition worsened by a misguided physician who prescribes morphine to ease her pain. When their father strikes oil, the family enjoys a new prosperity and the sisters meet the eligible Jack Herron, a fellow oil prospector. To Grace's shock, Jack falls in love with Edith and in her jealousy, Grace tells Jack that Edith, not she, has a drug problem. Hinting that her sister will soon need more morphine, Grace arranges for a dinner in Chinatown with the couple. While her sister and Jack dance, Grace slips away to an opium den. Edith follows her, but ends up in the wrong den and is arrested in an ensuing drug raid. After he bails her out of jail, Edith takes an angry Jack to search for Grace and stumbles across her half-conscious body lying in the street. The truth about the sisters is revealed, and after sending Grace to a sanitarium in the country, Jack and Edith are married.  \n",

Set in the hallucinatory period of time between September 11 and Halloween of 2001, The Unrecovered examines the effect of terror on the average mind, the way a state of heightened anxiety and/or alertness can cause the average person to make the sort of imaginative connections that are normally made only by artists and conspiracy theorists-both of whom figure prominently in this film. The Unrecovered explores the way in which irony, empathy, and paranoia relate to one another in the wake of 9/11.  "

In Ashe County, North Carolina residents have reported all manner of ghostly phenomena including apparitions of women, sounds of crying babies and phantom hitchhikers, one of which may have been none other than Lucifer himself. When Roxanne Wentworth purchased a beautiful set of iron gates from a local cemetery, she unknowingly turned her property into a gateway to the beyond. Paranormal events are now chronicled on a nightly basis. In Wilmington, North Carolina, Gallows Hill (which was once the city's hanging ground) is now a commercial office. Though the gallows are long gone, the unclaimed bodies of countless poor souls who hit the end of a rope are still buried in mass graves. These restless spirits continue to walk the grounds, and hallways of the property. The spirits of those executed are angry and to this day nobody has successfully spent a night alone in the house on Gallows Hill, though many have tried. Explore these encounters and more as we journey into the realms of the Paranormal and Supernatural.\",\n          \" Felix from West-Berlin falls in love with Thomas in East-Berlin.
